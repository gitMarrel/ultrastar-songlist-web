# Ultrastar Songlist Web
A simple but nice webpage I created to make my Ultrastar Songlist available to others to look at and search.
If you want to have a preview of how it looks, you can view my own songlist over on https://songs.mkrepinsky.de.
Works quite well both on mobile and on desktop ^_^
## Setup
 - Open up Ultrastar Manager and make sure all your songs show up there
 - Click on "Extras" -> "Create Report..."

 - In the popup, select only the items "Title" and "Artist" on the left and "All Songs" on the right (select no other options!)

 - Click on "CSV Export" and save the file as "songlist.csv" (replace the example file that comes with the project)
 - Drop the CSV file together with the rest of the files from the project onto a webserver aaaand you're done :)
